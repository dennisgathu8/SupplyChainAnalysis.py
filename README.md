Analyzing SKUs
There’s a column in the dataset as SKUs. You must have heard it for the very first time. So, SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. They’re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.
